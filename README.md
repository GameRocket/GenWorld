# GenWorld

GenWorld - a procedural generation toolkit for the "Unity" game engine. Allows you to procedurally generate content for a scene from voxels. Uses various algorithms and methods where you can change the frequency of appearance, size and color of voxel models. 

## How to use

## Standard set of voxels

Together with the project, a set of 16 standard voxels has already been added inside, which can later be replaced with your own. But now you can run all the methods and algorithms along with a standard set of voxels for debugging, testing, or to study how the tool works. Below is an image showing all 16 models and their names. All voxel models were created using "MagicaVoxel". https://ephtracy.github.io/
